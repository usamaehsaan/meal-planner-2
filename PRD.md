## 9. AI Considerations
### Data Sources:
MealPlanr will utilize user-provided dietary restrictions and budget, simulated local grocery price data (dummy data for MVP), comprehensive recipe database, and enhanced leftover tracking data.

### Model Selection:
For the MVP, a robust large language model (LLM) combined with specialized algorithms for price optimization, recipe generation, and leftover integration will be employed.

### Model Behavior Expectations:
MealPlanr's AI should act as a helpful and intelligent personal assistant for meal planning. It should prioritize user health and budget goals, provide clear and concise suggestions, and be adaptable to user feedback. The AI should focus on providing practical, actionable meal plans and shopping lists, emphasizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness while intelligently incorporating leftover ingredients and over-purchased items into future meal planning.
